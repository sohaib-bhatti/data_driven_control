Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a discrete-time algorithm used to decompose data into modes that give information about the spatial behavior of the system along with how it evolves in time. The problem to solve to find the linear operator $\mathbf{A}$ to relate two snapshots in time $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X'}$:
$$\mathbf{X'} \approx \mathbf{AX}$$
